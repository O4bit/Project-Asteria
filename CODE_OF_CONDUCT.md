# Project Asteria Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose
The goal of Project Asteria is to provide an open, welcoming, and collaborative environment for everyone interested in space, learning, and building. This Code of Conduct sets expectations and clarifies what behavior is and isn’t acceptable in all project spaces (GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, docs, chats, and any related community channels).

## 2. Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, visible or invisible difference, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity or expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion (or lack thereof), sexual orientation, or technology choices.

## 3. Our Standards
### Positive behaviors include:
- Showing empathy, kindness, patience, and respect.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Being clear, concise, and considerate in communication.
- Focusing on what is best for the project and community.
- Crediting others for their work and ideas.
- Using inclusive language.

### Unacceptable behaviors include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments.
- Trolling, flaming, or sustained disruption.
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome advances.
- Doxxing or publishing others’ private information without consent.
- Threats of violence or encouragement of self‑harm.
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 4. Scope
This Code applies within all project spaces and when an individual is representing the project or community in public spaces. Examples include using an official project account, posting via an official channel, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event.

## 5. Reporting
If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:
1. Collect relevant context (links, screenshots, timestamps) if safe to do so.
2. Send a report to: `o4bit@protonmail.com` (maintainer contact).
3. If the report involves a listed contact, you may escalate to the project owner directly (GitHub user: `O4bit`).

Anonymous reporting: If you prefer, you can create a throwaway email or GitHub account to file a report. Do not put yourself at risk to gather additional evidence.

## 6. Enforcement Guidelines
Project maintainers will follow these community impact guidelines when addressing violations. The severity and context will influence the chosen response.

| Level | Community Impact | Consequence |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| 1. Correction | Minor, first‑time inappropriate behavior. | A private, written warning including guidance on expected behavior. |
| 2. Warning | A pattern of behavior or more serious single incident. | A formal warning; continued violations may lead to temporary restrictions. |
| 3. Temporary Restriction | Continued violations after warning or significant impact. | Temporary (time‑boxed) ban from interaction (issues / PRs / discussions). Conditions for reinstatement will be stated. |
| 4. Permanent Ban | Demonstrated unwillingness to change or severe misconduct (harassment, threats, hate). | Permanent removal from all project spaces. |

Maintainers must document (privately) the rationale for enforcement actions to ensure consistency and accountability.

## 7. Appeals
If you believe an enforcement action was made in error, you may appeal once by replying to the notice with a concise rationale. Frivolous or hostile appeals may be dismissed.

## 8. Responsibility of Maintainers
Maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code fairly and consistently. They may remove or edit contributions that violate this Code (e.g., comments, commits, wiki edits, issues, pull requests) and may ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem harmful.

## 9. Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) version 2.1, and informed by enforcement ladder patterns used across major open source communities. For answers to common questions, see the [FAQ](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq).
